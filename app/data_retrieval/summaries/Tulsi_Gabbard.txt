Tulsi Gabbard (; born April 12, 1981) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Following her election in 2012, she became the first Samoan American and the first Hindu member of the United States Congress. She is a member of the Democratic Party.
Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in a combat zone in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009. She previously served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004. When she was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at age 21, Gabbard was the youngest woman to be elected to a U.S. state legislature. Gabbard was a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee until February 28, 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. 
As of 2019, Gabbard supports abortion rights, Medicare for All and same-sex marriage; she opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She is critical of interventionism in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. She also denounced U.S. involvement in the Yemeni Civil War and is outspoken against intervention in the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. Her opposition to removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power by force and her voting and lobbying against LGBT rights prior to 2005 have attracted controversy. She has since changed her views.
On January 11, 2019, Gabbard announced her campaign for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 2020.
