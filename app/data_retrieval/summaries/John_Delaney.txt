Delaney is often considered a centrist, and has touted his own bipartisan credentials as evidence of his ability to transcend the partisan divide. He has stated that he regards bipartisan cooperation as being of greater importance than progressive goals. Nevertheless, Delaney has also proclaimed himself to a progressive interested in creating "real–not political–progress." Delaney has also dubbed himself a "pragmatic progressive" and a "pragmatic idealist".
In his 2018 book Right Answer, Delaney wrote, While my policy instincts are often considered progressive, my political instincts have always been bipartisan.
In the House of Representatives, Delaney was a member of the New Democrat Coalition, a moderate and "pro-growth" Congressional Member Organization.Despite being frequently referred to as a "moderate", Delaney does not entirely identify as such. Delaney has remarked,

People have a hard time labeling me. Some of the things they hear me talking about are on the total progressive or liberal end of the spectrum, and in other ways I'm kind of a solutions-oriented moderate who wants to get things done.
