The 2020 presidential campaign of Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur and the founder of Venture for America, began on November 6, 2017, when Yang filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic primaries. Yang's unorthodox campaign strategy and platform have attracted attention, especially his heavy reliance upon Internet-based campaigning and his idea of a "Freedom Dividend," which is a form of Universal Basic Income.
