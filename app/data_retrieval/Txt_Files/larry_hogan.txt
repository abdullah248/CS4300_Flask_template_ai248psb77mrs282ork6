Lawrence Joseph Hogan Jr. (born May 25, 1956) is an American politician serving as the 62nd Governor of Maryland, since 2015.Elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2018, he is the second Republican Governor of Maryland in nearly 50 years and the first from Anne Arundel County, Maryland to be elected in over 100 years. He previously was Secretary of Appointments under Governor Bob Ehrlich from 2003 to 2007.


== Early life and education ==
Hogan was born in 1956 in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Landover, Maryland, attending Saint Ambrose Catholic School and DeMatha Catholic High School. He moved to Florida with his mother after his parents divorced in 1972 and graduated from Father Lopez Catholic High School in 1974. Hogan is the son of Nora (Maguire) and Lawrence Hogan Sr., who served as a U.S. Congressman from Maryland's 5th Congressional District from 1969 to 1975 and as Prince George's County Executive from 1978 to 1982 and was famous for being the first Republican member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. His parents were both of Irish descent.Hogan attended Florida State University from 1974 to 1978 and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and political science. While in college, Hogan worked in the Florida State Legislature and upon graduation, worked on Capitol Hill. Hogan helped his father run a successful campaign in 1978 for Prince George's County Executive and later worked for his father as a low-paid 'intergovernmental liaison'.


== Business career ==
In 1985, Hogan founded Hogan Companies, which is engaged in brokerage, consulting, investment and development of land, commercial and residential properties. He spent the next 18 years in the private sector.


== Civic and political career ==
As the son of a U.S. Congressman, Hogan was exposed to politics at a young age and worked in many aspects of politics including political campaigns and citizen referendums. Hogan served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in the 1970s and 1980s.


=== 1981 congressional special election ===
In 1981, at the age of 24, Hogan first ran for office in the special election to fill the vacancy in Maryland's 5th congressional district left by Gladys Noon Spellman. Spellman had succeeded Hogan's father in the congressional seat. Hogan finished 2nd out of 12 candidates in the Republican primary with 22.38% of the votes, behind  Audrey Scott who received 63.26%.


=== Congressional nominee ===
In the 1992 election cycle, Hogan was the Republican nominee for Maryland's 5th Congressional District, running against Democratic incumbent Steny Hoyer. The race was the closest in Hoyer's tenure, with Hogan winning 4 out of the district's 5 counties and taking 45% of the vote to Hoyer's 55%. No other challenger has come as close to unseating Hoyer since.


=== Cabinet secretary ===
Hogan took a temporary leave of absence from his business to serve as Maryland's Secretary of Appointments in the administration of Bob Ehrlich from 2003 to 2007. In this capacity, Hogan appointed over 7,000 individuals to positions in the Maryland government.


=== Change Maryland ===
In 2011, Hogan founded Change Maryland, a non-partisan grassroots organization. The organization was a frequent critic of tax increases in Maryland during the tenure of Governor Martin O'Malley.


== Governor of Maryland ==


=== 2014 gubernatorial campaign ===

Hogan announced his campaign for Governor of Maryland on January 21, 2014. On January 29, 2014, Hogan announced his running mate, former Maryland Secretary of General Services, Boyd Rutherford. On June 24, 2014, Hogan and Rutherford won the Republican primary, receiving 43% of the vote. They defeated the Democratic nominee, Anthony G. Brown, the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in an election on November 4, 2014.


=== 2018 gubernatorial campaign ===

On October 9, 2018, The Washington Post released an article with polling done both by that publication and University of Maryland showing that Hogan was leading Democrat Ben Jealous for Governor in the 2018 Maryland gubernatorial election, a month before election day. Hogan ultimately defeated Jealous, becoming only the second Republican governor in Maryland history to be reelected, and the first since Theodore McKeldin in 1954.


=== 2020 presidential speculation ===
During his January 16, 2019 inaugural address following re-election, Hogan strongly indicated he is considering launching a primary challenge against President Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election. Plans reported in February 2019 to attend a New Hampshire speaking series renewed speculation on the subject. In a CNBC interview published in March 2019, Hogan said he had been encouraged by many to run for president, had not given it much personal thought, yet would not rule it out.


=== Tenure ===
Hogan is a moderate Republican, deemed a "centrist and pragmatist", and is popular among Democrats. Hogan was "true to his promise to govern from the center in the first legislative session of his term." On the Issues, a non-profit and non-partisan organization which tracks politicians' positions, considers Hogan to be a centrist.


==== Approval ratings ====
Despite the fact that Democrats outnumber Republicans 2â€“1 in Maryland and Hogan has had some friction with the state's Democratic legislature, Hogan has enjoyed high approval ratings and is popular even among Democrats. A March 2016 Gonzales Poll showed Hogan held a 71% approval rating. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in April 2016 showed Hogan with a 66% approval rating. Hogan's favorable numbers were attributed to the improving economy in the state and Hogan's decision to govern "as a moderate, focusing on taxes and other pocketbook issues while avoiding polarizing social topics such as abortion or religious-objection laws." By November 2017, Hogan had one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country. A June 2018 poll showed that Hogan had a 60% approval rating among Democrats.


==== Environmental protection ====


===== Agricultural runoff into bodies of water =====

In February 2015, Hogan announced proposed regulatory changes on phosphorus nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The water was being polluted as a result of  agricultural runoff of chicken manure, which is used as a fertilizer by farmers and is cheap and plentiful in Maryland. Hogan proposed extending the time for about 80% of farmers to fully comply with regulations to 2022, while at the same time imposing a ban on additional phosphorus use by the largest farmers, and providing for indefinite delays if there was no other use for the manure. In March 2015, Hogan reached a compromise with Democrats in the General Assembly under which a hard date of 2022 was established, subject to a delay only to 2024 if no alternate uses for the manure can be found. The compromise "received tentative praise from both the agricultural community and environmentalists."Hogan was criticized for taking a large donation from a poultry company.


==== Paris agreement ====
In June 2017, Hogan maintained support for the Paris Agreement and opposed the United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. In 2016, Hogan signed legislation to reauthorize greenhouse gas reduction targets and mandate a 40% reduction in statewide carbon pollution by 2030. On January 10, 2018, Hogan said Maryland would join the United States Climate Alliance formed by California, New York, and Washington.


==== Hydraulic fracturing ====
In April 2017, Hogan signed a law banning hydraulic fracturing in Maryland. However, he did support pipelines in Maryland that transport natural gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing in other states.


==== Lawsuit regarding First Amendment rights ====
In January 2019, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates filed a lawsuit against the governor alleging violation of constitutional First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The governor had issued an executive order in October 2017 forbidding Marylanders who participate in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel from bidding on state contracts.


==== Immigration ====
Hogan opposed President Trump's decision to rescind DACA. He recalled Maryland's national guard from the US-Mexico border to protest the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policy which resulted in the separation of children from their parents.


==== Same-sex marriage and LGBT rights ====
Hogan, as a gubernatorial candidate, said that he was "originally for civil unions" but that he has evolved to support the decision to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2014, Hogan opposed a transgender rights law signed by Governor O'Malley. In May 2018, Hogan signed legislation into law making Maryland the 11th state to ban conversion therapy for minors.


==== Gun control ====
In October 2018, a law tightening gun control regulations that was signed by Hogan went into effect. The law banned bump stocks and banned gun ownership by convicted domestic abusers. Hogan was endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 2014, but in July 2018, Hogan said he would decline an endorsement and funds from the NRA if they were offered. In September 2018, the NRA downgraded its rating of Hogan to "C" and declined to endorse him.


==== Free community college tuition ====
In May 2018, Hogan announced he would sign a bill granting low- and middle-income students free community college tuition.


==== Cancellation of Baltimore Red Line light rail project ====

In June 2015, Hogan canceled the federally funded Baltimore Red Line project, instead choosing to reallocate money to road construction across Maryland, fulfilling a campaign promise to voters who elected him in 2014. Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn described the Red Line proposal as "fatally flawed" and argued that the light rail line would not connect with other public transportation hubs in Baltimore and would require the construction of a $1 billion tunnel through the heart of the city. However, plans detailed the Red Line would connect to the MARC Train at the West Baltimore station and planned Bayview station, the Baltimore Metro Subway at Charles Center station via a pedestrian tunnel, and with the Baltimore Light Rail at the University Center/Baltimore Street station at street level. The cancellation of the project was criticized by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. At the same time, Hogan conditionally approved funding for the Purple Line in Maryland's Washington, D.C. suburbs, subject to increased contributions from Montgomery County and Prince George's County.The anticipated reduction in Purple Line costs, combined with the availability of funding allocated for the Red Line, made it possible for the Hogan administration to commit to $1.97 billion for highways and bridges across the state of Maryland, including rural areas in both Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, as well as the densely populated counties near Baltimore and Washington D.C. The projects, which will get underway by 2018, include $1.35 billion in new projects going to construction and $625 million in preserved projects. The $1.35 billion in new projects includes $845 million for major projects and $500 million to fix bridges and improve roads.


==== Transportation scoring bill ====

In 2016, the Maryland General Assembly introduced HB 1013, the Maryland Open Transportation Investment Decision Act of 2016, which aims to establish statewide transportation goals through a transparent scoring process by the Maryland Department of Transportation. Inspired by Hogan's decision to cancel the Baltimore Red Line and shift funding to rural areas of the state, the legislation would require the Transportation Department to develop a project-based scoring system and promulgate regulations for the public.In April 2016, Hogan vetoed the bill claiming it was politically motivated and that it would increase the cancellation risk for major transportation projects throughout the state. Hogan claimed that the bill would force him to cancel 66 transportation projects and relabeled it the "Road Kill Bill". The General Assembly overrode Hogan's veto on April 8, 2016. Hogan deemed repealing the legislation to be his top priority, but gridlock and tension between the Governor and the legislature has prevented compromise on moving forward with an alternative.


==== Police and incarceration ====
In July 2015, Hogan announced the "immediate" closure of the decrepit Baltimore City Detention Center, which had a long record of poor conditions and dysfunction. Hogan did not notify Baltimore City mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake or leaders of the state general assembly about the plan. Hogan's move was supported by civil liberties and reform groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Justice Center, and Justice Policy Institute. The closure was viewed as orderly and successful by most, with the last prisoners being moved out of the jail in late August 2015.In 2016, Hogan re-opened the Maryland State Police Barrack in Annapolis, which had previously been closed in 2008 as a cost-savings measure.


==== 2015 Baltimore protests ====
The April 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American resident of Baltimore, Maryland, led to the 2015 Baltimore protests. To address the growing unrest, Hogan declared a state of emergency and activated the Maryland National Guard. Major General Linda L. Singh of the Maryland National Guard commented that there would be a "massive number" of soldiers in Maryland on the night of April 27, and that up to 5,000 soldiers were eventually deployed. Maryland State Police activated 500 officers for duty in Baltimore, and requested additional state police officers from other states.


==== 2016 presidential election ====

On July 15, 2015, Hogan endorsed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in his campaign for the Republican nomination for the presidency. In June 2016, despite the fact that Trump was endorsed by Christie at that time, Hogan stated that he had no plans to support Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.Hogan instead wrote in his own father, Lawrence Hogan (a former congressman and county executive of Prince George's County, Maryland) for president. Hogan did, however, attend Trump's inauguration.


==== Executive order for post-Labor Day school start date ====
In 2013, a bi-partisan commission including teachers, parents, political leaders, business leaders and local school officials outlined numerous benefits to a Post-Labor Day start to the school year and voted overwhelmingly (12â€“3) to recommend such a measure to then Governor Martin O'Malley.On August 31, 2016, Hogan issued an executive order to set the public schools start date after the Labor Day holiday.The Maryland State Education Association (MSEA) stated that Hogan's executive order would help the tourism industry but harm students in the classrooms. The MSEA stated that the later start prolongs summer brain drain and makes it difficult for students to return to their studies. MSEA also remarked that this change would harm low-income families due to the increased costs of paying for child care.The order was criticized by Teachers' Union and other political advocacy groups. However, the measure was extremely popular with Marylanders in both parties and across multiple demographic groups. 


==== Baltimore City schools budget crisis ====
In early 2017, Hogan proposed a budget that cut funding for community revitalization programs, extended library hours, and public schools in Baltimore City. Under the proposed budget, Baltimore City Public Schools would receive $42 million less than the prior year, further exacerbating the current $129 million budget gap. In February 2017, in response to the  funding crisis, citizens rallied in Annapolis. Hogan has criticized the school system for the mismanagement of funds, and has deemed the system's finances an "absolute disaster".


==== Abortion and reproductive rights ====
Hogan personally opposes abortion but said "he will not try to change Marylandâ€™s laws protecting women's rights to the procedure nor to limit access to contraception." Hogan has said that abortion should remain legal and NARAL Pro-Choice America, a political action committee which supports legal abortion, considers him to be "mixed-choice." In 2016, Hogan signed a law making birth control cheaper. In 2017, the legislature passed a bill to reimburse Planned Parenthood in the event that the federal government withdraws funding, and Hogan allowed the bill to become a law albeit without his signature. He characterized as unnecessary a 2018 initiative put forward by Democratic state lawmakers to protect abortion in the Maryland constitution but declined to oppose it and added that he supported allowing the vote. "Our laws in Maryland already guarantee a woman's right to choose," he said. "We have some very strong laws and any change in the Supreme Court would not affect Maryland, so I don't think that a constitutional amendment is required, but if that's what they want to do, I'm all for that. Let the voters decide."


==== Brett Kavanaugh nomination ====
In July 2018, Hogan was one of four Republican governors from Democratic-leaning states who chose not to sign a letter endorsing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. After allegations of sexual misconduct were made against Kavanaugh, Hogan joined three other Republican senators in signing a letter opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation without an independent investigation. After the investigation was concluded, Hogan declined to say whether or not he supported Kavanaugh's confirmation.


==== Facebook page controversies ====
Between taking office and February 2017, Hogan's Facebook page blocked over 450 people. One spokesman said about half had used "hateful or racist" language, while the rest were part of a "coordinated attack". Affected Marylanders said they had reached out to the governor via Facebook following the 2015 Baltimore protests as well as Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769 in January 2017, which banned travelers from 7 predominantly Muslim countries.In March 2017, it was discovered that Hogan staffers altered headlines of Baltimore Sun and DelmarvaNow articles posted in the governor's Facebook page to falsely imply General Assembly support for the Governor's so-called "Road Kill Bill"; after the Sun contacted the governor's office about the doctored headlines, the governor's office rectified the problem.


==== Sick-leave legislation ====
In December 2016, Hogan proposed state legislation to require companies  with 50 or more employees to provide 5 days per year of paid sick leave. Hogan's bill was less expansive than legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled Maryland House of Delegates; it also would have preempted local legislation that was more generous to employees, such as mandated paid sick leave required by Montgomery County, Maryland. In the legislature, Hogan's proposal failed to advance out of committee, and the House of Delegates passed more expansive legislation that requires companies with 15 employees or more to provide 7 paid sick-leave days a year, requires companies with fewer than 15 employees to provide 5 days of unpaid sick leave, and affords benefits for part-time employees. Hogan vetoed the more generous sick leave bill, but his veto was overridden.
