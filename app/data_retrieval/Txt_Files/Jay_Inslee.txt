The 2020 presidential campaign of Jay Inslee began when Inslee, the Governor of Washington, announced that he would be running for the Democratic nomination on March 1, 2019. He was chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 2018 and served as a co-chair of the United States Climate Alliance. He was the first governor to enter the race. Inslee's campaign centers around climate change and environmental issues.


== Background ==
Throughout 2018, speculation rose that Inslee was considering a run for President of the United States in the 2020 election. He garnered national attention due to Washington v. Trump, a lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration's order to ban entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. While serving as chair of the Democratic Governors Association during the 2018 gubernatorial elections, Inslee oversaw Democrats gaining seven net governorships nationwide, further propelling him into the national spotlight and fueling speculation that he would run. Inslee cited climate change as his primary motivation for running, strongly criticizing the Trump Administration's policies.On January 2, 2019, it was reported that Inslee was beginning to form an exploratory committee, the first step in a campaign. Inslee has pointed to former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, saying that they were once "pretty much unknown governors of small states" and adding, "this is a wide-open field. No one has a lock on this. No one has a total crystal ball as to what the nation wants." On February 28, 2019, it was reported that Inslee had hired former advisors of Tom Steyer.
